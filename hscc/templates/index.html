                            <p class="col-md-offset-1">The ACM High School Coding Competition is an annual programming competition held at Purdue University.  Purdue's ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Chapter hosts the competition.  High School Students from around the Midwest come to Purdue to compete.  Teams of two students attempt to solve programming questions in the shortest possible time.  The questions cover a variety of topics and difficulty levels.</p>
